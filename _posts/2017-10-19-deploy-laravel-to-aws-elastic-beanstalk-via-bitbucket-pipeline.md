Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php linenos %}
$car = 'string';
{% endhighlight %}
